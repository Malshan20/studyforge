              <p>
                StudyForge was born from the recognition that students needed more than just note-taking apps or simple
                to-do lists. They needed a comprehensive platform to forge their academic success through strategic
                planning and effective study methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                By combining intelligent study planning, adaptive flashcard systems, and detailed progress analytics
                with proven study methodologies, we've created a platform that helps students build the foundation for
                academic excellence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, StudyForge helps students organize their study schedules, master their subjects through spaced
                repetition flashcards, track their progress with comprehensive analytics, and build the habits that lead
                to lasting academic success.
